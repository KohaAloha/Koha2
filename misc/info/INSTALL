Koha release 2.0.1 (stable series, first point release)
28 August 2004 MJR

Koha is distributed under the GNU GPL. Please read the file LICENSE for
more details.

To install the system please run: perl installer.pl

This will:
 1. Check for missing perl modules;
 2. Ask some questions and run some programs to collect system information;
 3. Write an apache httpd.conf file;
 4. Copy koha to the installation directory;
 5. Create a mysql database and load in basic data;
 6. Offer to try restarting apache;
 7. Invite you to fill in a survey from koha's developers.

perl 5.6.1 or higher is required.

The perl modules required are:
  DBI, Date::Manip, DBD::mysql, HTML::Template, Digest::MD5,
  MARC::Record, Mail::Sendmail, Event
Optionally, we can also use:
  Net::Z3950
You can install packages for these, or CPAN builds. The installer will
suggest CPAN builds, but it's your choice.

After installation, you need to make sure the generated koha-httpd.conf
file is "Include"d into your apache configuration and restart apache.
You may also need to configure daemons, depending on your installation.

A common need is to add the fines2.pl script to crontab. You will need
to put perl -I/path/to/koha/intranet/modules /path/to/fines2.pl, so
that it can find the koha modules.

If you wish to install without being root, please set the "etcdir" and
"prefix" environment variables before running the installer. etcdir
will be the configuration directory and prefix will be the installation
root directory.
