	* C4/Biblio.pm: Added some FIXME comments.

	* search.pl: Added some FIXME comments.

	* moredetail.pl: C4::Acquisitions doesn't exist anymore. Replaced
	with C4::Catalogue (presumably this is correct, because
	&C4::Catalogue::getorder is exported, but &C4::Biblio::getorder
	isn't).
	Replaced an obviously-bogus assignment with a much more likely
	string comparison.

	* detail.pl (bug fix): This was always displaying the OPAC results
	page. Fixed by replacing an assignment with a string comparison.

	* deletebiblioitem.pl: Replaced nonexistent C4::Acquisitions with

	order. Changed octal values for permissions to the standard
	notation.

2002-10-14  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* installer.pl: Added quote so Emacs color doesn't get screwed up.

2002-10-13  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

2002-10-11  Andrew Arensburger  <arensb@baa.ooblick.com>

	* C4/Search.pm: Added a FIXME comment.

	* C4/Database.pm: Gutted. Every function in this module is now

	&z3950menu, so it'll print something instead of giving a browser
	error.

	* C4/Circulation/Circ2.pm: Removed bogus unused variables at the
	top. Prettified @EXPORT list.
	(bug fix): Added missing semicolon.

	* C4/Output.pm: Replaced &requireDBI with C4::Context->dbh, thus

	bit.
	* C4/Koha.pm: Removed trailing whitespace that was messing up the

	systempreferences table.

	* moremember.pl (bug fix): Titles and due dates weren't being
	retrieved properly due to missing braces. Added bug report: the
	item type still isn't being displayed.

	* C4/Search.pm: Made code a bit more Perl-ish.

	* member.pl: Use the default theme if it wasn't given as a CGI
	parameter.

	"update this member's information" page.

	the POD.

	* circ/circulation.pl: Added some FIXME comments.

	* circ/branchtransfers.pl (bug fix?) What looks like possibly a

	value from systempreferences (which is all most scripts need).

	* INSTALL: Clarified need for File::Spec. Rewrote sections on
	writing and installing koha.conf for clarity, and to reflect the
	fact that the config file no longer needs to go in /etc/koha.conf.
	Fixed typo in "SetEnv" example. Replaced "ur" with the English
	equivalent throughout.

	* C4/Output.pm: Added a couple of FIXME comments.

	* C4/Output.pm: Removed remnants of code that read /etc/koha.conf
	for itself.

	* Merged with arensb-context branch: use
	C4::Context->dbh instead of &C4Connect, and generally prefer
	C4::Context over C4::Database.

	* bookcount.pl: Merged with arensb-context branch: use
	C4::Context->dbh instead of &C4Connect, and generally prefer
	C4::Context over C4::Database.

	more fines

2001-04-03 14:32  rangi

	* C4/Circulation/Circ2.pm, circ/circulation.pl: Making a change to

	if a borrower owed more than $5 issues werent allowed. This worked
	fine except that often borrowers wish to borrows say 3 pay videos
	at $2 each, then 2 books say. The three pay videos rack up charges
	of $6 and then they cant issue the books until that is paid.

	accrued during current issue process.
