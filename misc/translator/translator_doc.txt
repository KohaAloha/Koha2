TRANSLATION TOOL, V3.0:
======================

This transation tool should greatly help Koha translators. It's composed of
2 scripts:

  * xgettext.pl, that extracts the texts in a template, and which is called by
    the script
  * tmpl_process3.tmpl, which can do 3 things:
      + create a file with all the "translatable strings" in all files in a
        directory (& its subdirectories)
      + update an existing translation file.
      + rebuild translated templates from english & translation file.

Call tmpl_process3.pl --help to get a more detailed explanation. Some
additional explanations are also available by calling perldoc tmpl_process3.pl.

HOW TO TRANSLATE Koha:
=====================

 1. Create your translation file (assuming your current directory is this
    directory, i.e., misc/translator):
   
        ./tmpl_process3.pl create -i ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -s css_opac_fr_FR.po -r
   
    (In the above example, ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ contains the
    English templates in the "default" theme, and po/css_opac_fr_FR.po is where
    you want the generated PO file to appear. The use of relative paths for the
    English templates is recommended but is not necessary; it makes the
    resulting PO files somewhat easier to read.)
 2. Translate your css_opac_fr_FR.po file using a text editor or a PO file
    translation tool.
 3. Create your translated templates:
   
        ./tmpl_process3.pl install -i ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -o ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/fr2/ -s css_opac_fr_FR.po -r
   
    (In the above example, /home/paul/koha.dev/koha/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default
    /fr2/ is where you want your translated templates to be saved.)
 4. Copy images/css files in your new directory (as they are NOT moved by
    tmpl_process3.pl install).

If something changes in English version:

 1. Update your translation file:
   
        ./tmpl_process3.pl update -i ../../opac-tmpl/default/en -s po/css_opac_fr_FR.po -r
   
 2. Translate your new css_opac_fr_FR.po file. Look for strings marked as
    "fuzzy" and strings that are not translated.
 3. Create your translated templates:
   
        ./tmpl_process.pl install -i ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/en/ -o ../../koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/default/fr2/ -s po/css_opac_fr_FR.po -r
   
 4. Copy new images/css files in your new directory if needed
 
REBUILD ALL
===========
The rebuild_lang.sh script can be used to rebuild all languages officially supported in 2.2 release, when needed.
Useful for developpers, probably useless for all end-users.


WEAKNESSES

For a somewhat up-to-date list of weaknesses, please run perldoc xgettext.pl
and perldoc tmpl_process3.pl and read the BUGS sections.
