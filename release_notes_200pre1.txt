RELEASE NOTES
=============
This release add many bugfixes, and some improvment in z3950 and repetable fields management.


PACKAGE NEEDED :

Nothing new. Note MARC::Record has new releases, but older one (1.26) works fine.

DB modifications :
---------
No modif in the DB.

z3950 :
---------
* works on biblio adding & modifying
* works on ISBN, author, title, the 1st found being the one used.

various :
----------
* added subject and subtitle to MARC subfields mapped to Koha old-DB.
* reordered bookfunds/budget admin tools.

GUI reordering
------------------
* Some unused links have been dropped.
* a "submenu" shows some operation below main menu.
* the MARC link disappeared. It's managed by the MARC=ON/OFF systempref. (the breeding import is now in Parameters section)
* acquisition and cataloguing are now separated. acquisition=simple/normal in systempref and cataloguing is MARC/nonMARC depending on MARC=ON/OFF systempref.

Should be easier to understand.
