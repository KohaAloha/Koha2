RELEASE NOTES
=============
This version of Koha is the first in the 2.0 "stable" series.
It does not mean that it has no bugs, but least five libraries are using it and don't encounter impossible problems.
If you want to adopt Koha, please do, but you're warned that this release candidate version may still have some bugs and missing features. If you test it and let us know about any we haven't seen yet, it will help us to fix them.
