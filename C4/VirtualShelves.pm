=head1 NAME

C4::VirtualShelves - Functions for manipulating Koha virtual virtualshelves

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use C4::VirtualShelves;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions for manipulating virtual virtualshelves,
including creating and deleting virtualshelves, and adding and removing
items to and from virtualshelves.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 2

=item GetShelves

  $shelflist = &GetShelves($owner);
  $shelflist = &GetShelves($owner, $mincategory);
  $shelflist = &GetShelves($owner, $mincategory, $limit);
  ($shelfnumber, $shelfhash) = each %{$shelflist};

Looks up the virtual virtualshelves, and returns a summary. C<$shelflist>
is a reference-to-hash. The keys are the virtualshelves numbers
(C<$shelfnumber>, above), and the values (C<$shelfhash>, above) are
themselves references-to-hash, with the following keys:

C<mincategory> : 2 if the list is for "Public", 3 for "Open".
virtualshelves of the owner are always selected, whatever the category

=over 4

=item C<$shelfhash-E<gt>{shelfname}>

A string. The name of the shelf.

=item C<$shelfhash-E<gt>{count}>

The number of virtuals on that virtualshelves.

=item GetShelf

  (shelfnumber,shelfname,owner,category,sortfield) = &GetShelf($shelfnumber);

Looks up information about the contents of virtual virtualshelves number
C<$shelfnumber>

Returns the database's information on 'virtualshelves' table.

=item GetShelfContents

  $itemlist = &GetShelfContents($shelfnumber);

Looks up information about the contents of virtual virtualshelves number
C<$shelfnumber>.  Sorted by a field in the biblio table.  copyrightdate 
gives a desc sort.

Returns a reference-to-array, whose elements are references-to-hash,
as returned by C<C4::Biblio::GetBiblioFromItemNumber>.

Note: the notforloan status comes from the itemtype, and where it equals 0
it does not ensure that related items.notforloan status is likewise 0. The
caller has to check any items on their own, possibly with CanBookBeIssued
from C4::Circulation.

=item DelFromShelf
