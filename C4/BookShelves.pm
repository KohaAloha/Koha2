=head1 NAME

C4::BookShelves - Functions for manipulating Koha virtual bookshelves

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use C4::BookShelves;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions for manipulating virtual bookshelves,
including creating and deleting bookshelves, and adding and removing
items to and from bookshelves.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 2

=cut

@ISA = qw(Exporter);
@EXPORT = qw(&GetShelfList		&GetShelfContents		&GetShelf
			&AddToShelf			&AddToShelfFromBiblio
			&RemoveFromShelf	&AddShelf				&ModifShelf 
			&RemoveShelf		&ShelfPossibleAction
				);

my $dbh = C4::Context->dbh;

=item ShelfPossibleAction

=over 4

=item C<$loggedinuser,$shelfnumber,$action>

$action can be "view" or "manage".

Returns 1 if the user can do the $action in the $shelfnumber shelf.
Returns 0 otherwise.

=back

=cut
sub ShelfPossibleAction {
	my ($loggedinuser,$shelfnumber,$action)= @_;
	my $sth = $dbh->prepare("select owner,category from bookshelf where shelfnumber=?");
	$sth->execute($shelfnumber);
	my ($owner,$category) = $sth->fetchrow;
	return 1 if (($category>=3 or $owner eq $loggedinuser) && $action eq 'manage');
	return 1 if (($category>= 2 or $owner eq $loggedinuser) && $action eq 'view');
	return 0;
}

=item GetShelfList

  $shelflist = &GetShelfList();
  ($shelfnumber, $shelfhash) = each %{$shelflist};

Looks up the virtual bookshelves, and returns a summary. C<$shelflist>
is a reference-to-hash. The keys are the bookshelf numbers
(C<$shelfnumber>, above), and the values (C<$shelfhash>, above) are
themselves references-to-hash, with the following keys:

=over 4

=item C<$shelfhash-E<gt>{shelfname}>

A string. The name of the shelf.

=item C<$shelfhash-E<gt>{count}>

The number of books on that bookshelf.

=back

=cut
#'
# FIXME - Wouldn't it be more intuitive to return a list, rather than
# a reference-to-hash? The shelf number can be just another key in the
# hash.

	return $sth->fetchrow;
}
=item GetShelfContents

  $itemlist = &GetShelfContents($env, $shelfnumber);

Looks up information about the contents of virtual bookshelf number
C<$shelfnumber>.

Returns a reference-to-array, whose elements are references-to-hash,
as returned by C<&getiteminformation>.

I don't know what C<$env> is.

=cut

sub GetShelfContents {
    my ($env, $shelfnumber) = @_;

	push (@itemlist, $item);
    }
    return (\@itemlist);
}

=item AddToShelf

  &AddToShelf($env, $itemnumber, $shelfnumber);

Adds item number C<$itemnumber> to virtual bookshelf number
C<$shelfnumber>, unless that item is already on that shelf.

C<$env> is ignored.

=cut
#'
sub AddToShelf {
	my ($env, $itemnumber, $shelfnumber) = @_;

		$sth->execute($shelfnumber, $itemnumber);
	}
}

=item RemoveFromShelf

  &RemoveFromShelf($env, $itemnumber, $shelfnumber);

Removes item number C<$itemnumber> from virtual bookshelf number
C<$shelfnumber>. If the item wasn't on that bookshelf to begin with,
nothing happens.

C<$env> is ignored.

=cut
#'
sub RemoveFromShelf {
    my ($env, $itemnumber, $shelfnumber) = @_;
    my $sth=$dbh->prepare("delete from shelfcontents where shelfnumber=? and itemnumber=?");
    $sth->execute($shelfnumber,$itemnumber);
}

=item AddShelf

  ($status, $msg) = &AddShelf($env, $shelfname);

Creates a new virtual bookshelf with name C<$shelfname>.

Returns a two-element array, where C<$status> is 0 if the operation
was successful, or non-zero otherwise. C<$msg> is "Done" in case of
success, or an error message giving the reason for failure.

C<$env> is ignored.

sub AddShelf {
    my ($env, $shelfname, $owner, $category) = @_;
    my $sth=$dbh->prepare("select * from bookshelf where shelfname=?");

	$sth->execute($shelfname,$owner,$category,$shelfnumber);
}

=item RemoveShelf

  ($status, $msg) = &RemoveShelf($env, $shelfnumber);

Deletes virtual bookshelf number C<$shelfnumber>. The bookshelf must
be empty.

Returns a two-element array, where C<$status> is 0 if the operation
was successful, or non-zero otherwise. C<$msg> is "Done" in case of
success, or an error message giving the reason for failure.

C<$env> is ignored.

    my ($env, $shelfnumber) = @_;
