# This module dynamically pulls amazon content into Koha.  It does not
# store the data in Koha's database.  You'll need to get a developer's key
# as well as an associate's tag to use it.
# FIXME: need to write up more docs.
#
# To use this module you need to do three things:
# 1. get a dev key and associate tag from Amazon
# 2. uncomment the Amazon stuff in opac-detail.pl
# 3. add the template variables to opac-detail.tmpl
#    here's what's available: 
#    ProductDescription
#    ImageUrlMedium
#    ListPrice
#    url
#    loop SimilarProducts (Product)
#    loop Reviews (rating, Summary)
