Notes on making non-en versions of the images with the same look as the en ones

Fonts and adjustments:
The en images use artificially-compressed versions of Helvetica;
the ratio of the compression is not consistent among different images

koha.gif	Adobe Helvetica Bold 12px 82%
		Century Sclbk L Bold 15px [substitute; correct font not found]
		Century Sclbk L Italic 15px [substitute; correct font not found]
heading-*	Adobe Helvetica 24px 84%
inside-*	Adobe Helvetica 26px 88.29%
menu-*		Adobe Helvetica Bold 14px 81.58%
		[Must resize the *canvas* & leave 12px margin-right]
search-button	Adobe Helvetica 24px 82%
		Adobe Helvetica 18px 91%

For other images, to determine the ratio of the artificial compression:

- Guess the correct font (guess Helvetica for sans-serif)
- Using the text tool, type the English text
- Guess the font size, repeating guess until the text you type is the same
  height as the original English text
- Measure the width of the original English text
- Using the transform tool, determine the width of the text you typed
- Based on the above 2 measurements, determine the ratio of the artificial
  compression
- Delete the English text you typed, and replace it with a translation
- Using the transform tool, artificially compress your translated text
- Write down the information you find (font name, variant, and ratio of
  compression) in the layer name and perhaps also here

To create the gif files:

- If there are supposed to be transparent areas, but need to use a solid
  background to prevent colour problems with converting to index mode:
  - Flatten image
  - Select all, Copy
  - Add alpha channel, Add layer mask
  - Paste (in layer mask), Anchor layer
  - Image|Color|Invert
  - Image|Color|Threshold| 1-255
  - Apply layer mask
  - Save as gif

- If there are no trasparent areas:
  - Flatten image
  - Save as .gif

- If there are transparent areas:
  - Merge visible layers
  - Delete all invisible layers (to avoid problems converting to index mode)
  - Save as gif
