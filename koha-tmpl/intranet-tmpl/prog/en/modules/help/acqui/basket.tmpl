 <h1>Placing an Order Help</h1><h2>What is a Basket and Order?</h2>

<p>A Basket is used to group a set of order lines. An order is placed for an individual item. </p><p>An Order can have multiple copies/units placed against it.&nbsp; A Basket can have multiple Orders.</p>

<h2>How do I add Items to an Order?</h2><ol><li><strong>From an existing record -</strong> Use the search to locate the bibliographic recrod of the item that you wish to order more copies of. </li><li><strong>From A Suggestion - </strong>view suggestions placed by Patrons and add to the item to the basket. </li><li><strong>From a new (empty) record - </strong>If you know that the item is not in the library already, then create a new record from scratch. </li></ol><h3>TIP: Always check your Catalogue first </h3>

<p>It is highly advisable that you get in the habit of checking the catalogue first before placing an order for a new item. This saves unnecessary duplicate Bibliographic records in your database and any need to merge/deduplicate records.</p>

<h2>Do I have to &quot;Close&quot; a Basket?</h2>

<p>No. A basket is simply a way that a set of orders can be grouped together. You may chose to &quot;Close A Basket&quot; when the Order for all the items in the basket has been placed with the Vendor. A basket does not need to be closed to recieve the items that have been ordered within that basket.</p>

<h2>Where do I enter a purchase order number? </h2>

<p>Purchase order numbers are entered against orders, not baskets. See <strong>Add To Order</strong></p>
