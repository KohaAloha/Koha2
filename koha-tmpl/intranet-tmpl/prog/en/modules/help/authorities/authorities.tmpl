Clicking on these dots will open a pop-up window allowing the cataloger to search your authority records for a standardized version of the author's name. If the desired name is found in your authority records, it can be automatically copied into the 700a subfield. (If the desired name is not found, the cataloger can enter the name manually.)</p><p id="lw_p">&nbsp;</p><br /><h2 id="shj0">Auto-detection of authority records when a record is saved</h2>Alternatively, the library can opt into the auto-detection of authority records when a record is saved.&nbsp; This is done by turning the 'BiblioAddsAuthorities' system preference on.<br /><ul><li><em>Get there:</em> More &gt; Administration &gt; Global preferences &gt; Authorities &gt; BiblioAddsAuthorities</li></ul><br /><h2 id="x3.y">Library-maintained authority records</h2>A third option allows libraries to maintain their own authority records based on the dataset; many libraries prefer not to enable that option because it creates 'ghost' authority records in the system. It's up to the library (or group) which options to enable, or disable. <br /> <br />
