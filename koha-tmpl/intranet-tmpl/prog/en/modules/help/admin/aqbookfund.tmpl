<h1>Fund Administration</h1>

<p>The first time you access this page, you will be asked to add your first fund -- thereafter you will also have the option of editing and deleting funds.</p>

<p>Funds may be ignored if you are setting your System Preferences to "simple" acquisitions: the funds are only useful when using "normal" acquisitions.</p>

<p>"Funds" are accounts that you establish to keep track of your expenditures for library materials. They may be used for any kind of material and should match the lines in your materials budget. For instance, if your library establishes a budget line for books, another for audiovisual materials, a third line for magazines, and a fourth budget line for electronic databases, then you would have four funds.</p>

<p>Each fund has a unique fund code, limited to no more than five characters, that identifies it. You should decide on your fund codes (e.g. something like BOOKS, AV, MAGS, DATA for the four funds described above) and enter the code in the "fund" box, then a full name in the "Name" box.</p>

<p>Once you have set up a fund, you will see a link to a page for setting up the fund budget. Here you will enter the beginning and ending dates of your budget year and the amount of money in that particular budget line. Do not use any kind of currency notation (like "$") or commas when entering the number. (Commas will be converted to decimal points.) NOTE: Your dates will not saved correctly unless you have set your date format in the System Preferences section of the Parameters page -- DO THIS BEFORE setting budgets.)</p>
