It will prevent duplicates from coming into the system when importing MARC records. <h2 id="lif:"> </h2>An import rule or matching rule consists of one or more 'match points' and zero or more 'match checks'. Each match point specifies a 'search index' and a MARC 'tag', 'subfield', or 'length' (fixed field position) when a record is imported. For each match point, a string is constructed from the tag specified in the match point and the related index is searched.<br /> <br /> The set of matching records are assigned a score (the value of which is determined by the match point rule). Then, the rest of the match points are considered and the scores of each set of matches is added up. The set of matching records whose total score is over a threshold value defined in the matching rule are candidate matches.<br /> <br /> Match checks are applied for all candidate matches. Each match check specifies a tag in the incoming record and a tag in the possible matching record. The values must be the same for a match to be considered good (e.g., doing a match check on title, or publication date)
