	<h1>Serials issues & summary</h1>
	<p>This screen is divided in 2 parts</p>
	<h2>The right part</h2>
	<p>The right part deals with issues. When you create a new subscription, the 1st issue is automatically calculated. When you want/need, you can define issues that have a new status:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Arrived : when an book arrives, you can set it's status to "arrived". Then, the issue disappear from this list, and the number of the issue is added to the "arrived list" (on the left box)</li>
		<li>Late : means that the book is late and should be arrived. A books changed to "late" status stays on the issue list, and the next waited number is generated</li>
		<li>Missing : means the book will never arrive. The issue disappear from the list, and the number of the issue is added to the "missing list" (on the left box)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>The left part</h2>
	<p>the left part contains 6 differents informations, that are automatically calculated for some of them, but that you can change<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Anfangsdatum Abonnement: Das Datum, an dem das 1. Abonnement beginnt. Es sollte nicht ge&auml;ndert werden, und es wird auch nicht automatisch bei der Erneuerung des Abonnements ge&auml;ndert</li>
		<li>Enddatum Abonnement: mu&szlig; per hand eingegeben werden, wenn das Abonnement tats&auml;chlich beendet ist</li>
		<li>Arrived numbers : the list of issues you have in your library. Automatically filled when a new number is marked "arrived". You can manually change this field if you want, for example, to change a long list (1,2,3,4,...,51) to a shorter one (1-51)</li>
		<li>Missing numbers : the list of issues you don't have in your library, and that will never arrive (or have been lost). Automatically filled when a new number is marked "missing". You can manually change this field if you want, for example, to change a long list (1,2,3,4,...,51) to a shorter one (1-51)</li>
		<li>opac note : the field that appears in the OPAC (with some other subscription information like beginning date & end date. This field must be filled manually. Nothing is put here automatically</li>
		<li>opac note : the field that appears in the librarian interface (with some other subscription information like beginning date & end date. This field must be filled manually. Nothing is put here automatically.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Aboverl&auml;ngerung</h2>
	<p>Koha calculates automatically the end of the subscription (based on the start date and the number of issues recieved). when a subscription has ended, you can't change the status of the last "waited number" (as it's not waited in fact). To be able to "recieve" this number, you must renew your subscription.</p>
	<p>Renewing a subscription means that you define some informations for the renewal. When those informations have been filled, a suggestion is automatically created in Koha. This suggestion can be managed by the librarian that orders books, as any other order (= budget & bookseller are defined here).</p>
	<p><i>Note that the subscription renewal done by the "serials librarian" is supposed to be immediate. We have decided to keep Koha as simple as possible. In fact, the subscription renewal won't be immediate, but we didn't wanted to add too much complexity.</i></p>
