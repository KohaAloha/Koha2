Dear library user,

You have suggested to the library to buy <!-- TMPL_VAR name="title" --> <!-- TMPL_IF name="author" -->from <!-- TMPL_VAR name="author" --><!-- /TMPL_IF -->

<!-- TMPL_VAR name="lib.surname" --> <!-- TMPL_VAR lib.firstname --> managed your suggestions today, and found it interesting.
The document will be bought as soon as possible. You will be warned by mail when the acquisition will be done, then mailed again when the book arrives at the library.

Ask any question to <!-- TMPL_VAR name="libemail" -->
-- 
You library
