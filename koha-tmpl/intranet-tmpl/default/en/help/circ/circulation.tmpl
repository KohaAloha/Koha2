<h1>Circulation / Issues help</h1>
<p>Before you begin, it is very important that you take note of the branch and printer settings and change them if necessary. This should only have to be done the first time you do circulations from a workstation, after which a browser cookie will remember the correct settings. If you do circulations under the wrong branch settings (for example, your branch setting is "Suburb," but you are actually working at the "Downtown" branch), then Koha will reset the location of all items scanned to the incorrect branch (Suburb) and the statistical reports will credit all circulations to the wrong branch.</p>

<p>Now start by scanning the borrower's barcode or type in their name to find their account. Once Koha has found the borrower, you will see a new form for scanning or typing the item's identifying number (usually a barcode).</p>

<p>If you wish to have this item and all subsequent items in this transaction to have a date due other than the default date due defined for the item type, use the "Sticky Due Date" to set the date due before scanning the first item.</p>

<p>If the issuing has nothing specific, it will be done immediatly and shown (with other borrower issues) at bottom.</p>
<p>If the issuing is problematic, then another box will appear (in <b>RED</b>) and ask for confirmation if possible. If the issuing is really impossible (for example, the barcode does not exist), then you can't confirm the issue. If it is possible but has something that needs confirmation (like item being issued to another borrower, or borrower having issued too many items), then you must confirm the issuing. If the confirmation means another operation (if item is issued to another borrower, then issuing also means make the return), then it's also done</p>
