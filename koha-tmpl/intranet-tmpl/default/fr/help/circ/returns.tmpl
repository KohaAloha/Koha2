<p>Before you begin, it is very important that you take note of the branch and printer settings and change them if necessary. This should only have to be done the first time you do circulations (or returns) from a workstation, after which a browser cookie will remember the correct settings. If you do returns under the wrong branch settings (for example, your branch setting is "Suburb," but you are actually working at the "Downtown" branch), then Koha will reset the location of all items scanned to the incorrect branch (Suburb).</p>

<p>Now simply scan or type the returned item's identifying number (usually a barcode) in the box provided.</p>

<p>The return is done and if there is something specific for the item or the borrower (like borrower having debts), a red box will warn you</p>
<p>If the item has been requested by someone else, you also are asked to validate the request. If you confirm it, item is changed to a "waiting" status and you should warn the borrower that the item is available</p>
<p>If the item is requested by someone in anothe branch, then you must validate the transfer too</p>
